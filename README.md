# UHM TO WT

Just an attempt to convert .uhm files into .wt files

Right now, is very buggy, and can only support certain commands (and formula expressions)

### Commands

- [x] Info
- [x] NumFrames
- [x] Seed
- [x] Wave
- [x] Spectrum (\*)
- [ ] Phase
- [ ] Import
- [ ] Export
- [ ] Move
- [ ] Interpolate
- [x] Normalize (\*)
- [ ] Envelope

(\*) means *is buggy*.

### Formula Expressions

More not done than done.
